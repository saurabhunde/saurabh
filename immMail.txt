Hi,

Government of Canada recently unveiled its immigration plans to allocate one million permanent resident visas to immigrants between 2018 and 2020. 

That is a great option for professionals who want a global career and high quality of life with benefits like free schooling for kids and free healthcare for family. Australia & some other countries like New Zealand & Denmark also have similar programs that allow professionals to pursue international careers in these countries.

These countries have become the most popular destinations for people all over the world as they have a very promising market and one of the highest per capita income globally. Most of these countries have an elaborate point system for evaluating and accepting your application. If you are interested in settling abroad, you can get your profile evaluated at an Immigration Seminar scheduled in your city. ISA offers a technical evaluation for those looking to migrate as it allows you to check if you qualify for immigration & keeps the success rate high.

To know more, you can attend a Seminar scheduled by ISA on weekends (Saturdays or Sundays), in your city (there is no registration fees):
